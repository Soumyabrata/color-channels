### Manuscript
The author version of this manuscript is `manuscript.PDF`. 

### Code Organization
All codes are written in MATLAB. 

The dataset used in this manuscript is HYTA dataset from Li et. al, A Hybrid Thresholding Algorithm for Cloud Detection on Ground-Based Color Images, *Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology*, 2011. Please contact the respective authors for the dataset. Please save the dataset images and ground-truth maps in the folder `HYTA+GT`.

In addition to all the related codes, we have also shared the pre-computed results generated from HYTA dataset. The pre-computed files (in case HYTA dataset is not present) are contained in the folder `precomputed`.
